## Overview

This Flask-based web application serves as a task tracker, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their tasks. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, making it easy to keep track of their activities and to-do lists.

## Features

- User Registration: New users can create an account by providing a username and password.
- User Authentication: Registered users can log in to access their personalized task dashboard.
- Task Management:
  - Add Task: Users can add tasks by providing a title and description.
  - Edit Task: Users can modify the title and description of existing tasks.
  - Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from their dashboard.
- User-Friendly Interface: The web app is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**:
   - Users start by registering for an account with a unique username and password.
   - User passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Registered users can log in using their username and password.
   - Session-based authentication keeps users logged in until they choose to log out.

3. **Task Management**:
   - Once logged in, users can:
     - Add new tasks by specifying a title and description.
     - Edit existing tasks by modifying their title and description.
     - Delete tasks they no longer need.
   - The task dashboard displays the user's tasks in an organized manner.

4. **Logout**:
   - Users can log out of their accounts to securely end their session.
